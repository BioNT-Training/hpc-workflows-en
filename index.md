## Disclaimer

This training material is intended for educational and informational purposes
only. While it explains how to use an HPC environment based on
[SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html),
[modules](https://lmod.readthedocs.io),
and related technologies, access to computational
infrastructure required to complete the exercises is not provided.

Learners are responsible for arranging their own access to suitable
computational resources.

As an alternative, users may consider setting up a local test environment using
the open-source project [slurm-docker-cluster](https://github.com/giovtorres/slurm-docker-cluster).
A detailed example of how to use this project is described in a
[third-party blog post from Thomas Sandmann](https://tomsing1.github.io/blog/posts/slurm_docker_cluster/)

Use of any third-party tools or documentation is at your own discretion and risk.
